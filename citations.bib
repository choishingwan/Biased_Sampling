	abstract = {Polygenic risk scores have shown great promise in predicting complex disease risk and will become more accurate as training sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R2 increased from 20.1\% to 25.3\% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8\% to 12.0\% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase.},

	abstract = {Summary: A polygenic risk score (PRS) is a sum of trait-associated alleles across many genetic loci, typically weighted by effect sizes estimated from a genome-wide association study. The application of PRS has grown in recent years as their utility for detecting shared genetic aetiology among traits has become appreciated; PRS can also be used to establish the presence of a genetic signal in underpowered studies, to infer the genetic architecture of a trait, for screening in clinical trials, and can act as a biomarker for a phenotype. Here we present the first dedicated PRS software, PRSice (‘precise'), for calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of PRS. PRSice can calculate PRS at a large number of thresholds (“high resolution”) to provide the best-fit PRS, as well as provide results calculated at broad P-value thresholds, can thin Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) according to linkage disequilibrium and P-value or use all SNPs, handles genotyped and imputed data, can calculate and incorporate ancestry-informative variables, and can apply PRS across multiple traits in a single run. We exemplify the use of PRSice via application to data on schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and smoking, illustrate the importance of identifying the best-fit PRS and estimate a P-value significance threshold for high-resolution PRS studies.
Availability and implementation: PRSice is written in R, including wrappers for bash data management scripts and PLINK-1.9 to minimize computational time. PRSice runs as a command-line program with a variety of user-options, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.info

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs), also called common variant association studies (CVASs), have uncovered thousands of genetic variants associated with hundreds of diseases. However, the variants that reach statistical significance typically explain only a small fraction of the heritability. One explanation for the “missing heritability” is that there are many additional disease-associated common variants whose effects are too small to detect with current sample sizes. It therefore is useful to have methods to quantify the heritability due to common variation, without having to identify all causal variants. Recent studies applied restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation to case–control studies for diseases. Here, we show that REML considerably underestimates the fraction of heritability due to common variation in this setting. The degree of underestimation increases with the rarity of disease, the heritability of the disease, and the size of the sample. Instead, we develop a general framework for heritability estimation, called phenotype correlation–genotype correlation (PCGC) regression, which generalizes the well-known Haseman–Elston regression method. We show that PCGC regression yields unbiased estimates. Applying PCGC regression to six diseases, we estimate the proportion of the phenotypic variance due to common variants to range from 25\% to 56\% and the proportion of heritability due to common variants from 41\% to 68\% (mean 60\%). These results suggest that common variants may explain at least half the heritability for many diseases. PCGC regression also is readily applicable to other settings, including analyzing extreme-phenotype studies and adjusting for covariates such as sex, age, and population structure.},

	abstract = {Author Summary   It is well known that mating between relatives increases the risk that a child will have a rare recessive genetic disease, but there has also been increasing interest and inconsistent findings on whether inbreeding is a risk factor for common, complex psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The best powered study to date investigating this theory predicted that the odds of developing schizophrenia increase by approximately 17\% for every additional percent of the genome that shows evidence of inbreeding. In this replication, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data from 18,562 schizophrenia cases and 21,268 controls to quantify the degree to which they were inbred and to test the hypothesis that schizophrenia cases show higher mean levels of inbreeding. Contrary to the original study, we did not find evidence for distant inbreeding to play a role in schizophrenia risk. There are various confounding factors that could explain the discrepancy in results from the original study and our replication, and this should serve as a cautionary note–careful attention should be paid to issues like ascertainment when using the data from genome-wide case-control association studies for secondary analyses for which the data may not have originally been intended.},

We propose the name “the coefficient of discrimination” for this statistic, and recommend its use as a standard measure of explanatory power. In its intuitive interpretation, this quantity has no immediate relation to the classical versions of R2, but it turns out to be related to these by two exact relations, which imply that all these statistics are asymptotically equivalent.},

Phasing is generally performed via statistical phasing in a genotyped cohort, an approach that can yield high accuracy in very large cohorts but attains lower accuracy in smaller cohorts. Here we instead explore the paradigm of reference-based phasing. We introduce a new phasing algorithm, Eagle2, that attains high accuracy across a broad range of cohort sizes by efficiently leveraging information from large external reference panels (such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium; HRC) using a new data structure based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform. We demonstrate that Eagle2 attains a {\textasciitilde}20× speedup and {\textasciitilde}10\% increase in accuracy compared to reference-based phasing using SHAPEIT2. On European-ancestry samples, Eagle2 with the HRC panel achieves {\textgreater}2× the accuracy of 1000 Genomes–based phasing.

	abstract = {Fine-scale estimation of recombination rates remains a challenging problem. Experimental techniques can provide accurate estimates at fine scales but are technically challenging and cannot be applied on a genome-wide scale. An alternative source of information comes from patterns of genetic variation. Several statistical methods have been developed to estimate recombination rates from randomly sampled chromosomes. However, most such methods either make poor assumptions about recombination rate variation, or simply assume that there is no rate variation. Since the discovery of recombination hotspots, it is clear that recombination rates can vary over many orders of magnitude at the fine scale. We present a method for the estimation of recombination rates in the presence of recombination hotspots. We demonstrate that the method is able to detect and accurately quantify recombination rate heterogeneity, and is a substantial improvement over a commonly used method. We then use the method to reanalyze genetic variation data from the HLA and MS32 regions of the human genome and demonstrate that the method is able to provide accurate rate estimates and simultaneously detect hotspots.},

A random general population sample (ages 20–70 years), from two Finnish cities was surveyed with the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). In addition, questions regarding diagnosed lifetime mental disorders, health care use for psychiatric reasons in the past 12 months, and history of mental disorders in first-degree relatives were posed. Among the 441 subjects who participated, neuroticism correlated strongly with symptoms of depression (rs=.71, P{\textless}.001) and anxiety (rs=.69, P{\textless}.001), and somewhat with selfreported lifetime mental disorder (rs=.30, P{\textless}.001) and health care use for psychiatric reasons in the past 12 months (rs=.24, P{\textless}.001). Extraversion correlated negatively with symptoms of depression (rs=−.47, P{\textless}.001), anxiety (rs=−.36, P{\textless}.001), selfreported lifetime mental disorder (rs=−.17, P{\textless}.001), and health care use for psychiatric reasons in the past 12 months (rs=−.14, P=.004). In multiple regression models, even after adjusting for gender, age, and education, BDI scores were significantly associated with neuroticism, extraversion, and age, whereas BAI scores were associated only with neuroticism. Neuroticism is strongly associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, and intraversion is moderately associated with depressive symptoms in the urban general population. The relationship of these personality dimensions to both selfreported lifetime mental disorders and use of health services for psychiatric reasons strengthens the clinical validity of these personality dimensions.

	abstract = {Going Ape Over Genetic Maps
Recombination is an important process in generating diversity and producing selectively advantageous genetic combinations. Thus, changes in recombination hotspots may influence speciation. To investigate the variation in recombination processes in humans and their closest existing relatives, Auton et al. (p. 193, published online 15 March) prepared a fine-scale genetic map of the Western chimpanzee and compared it with that of humans. While rates of recombination are comparable between humans and chimpanzees, the locations and genetic motifs associated with recombination differ between the species.
To study the evolution of recombination rates in apes, we developed methodology to construct a fine-scale genetic map from high-throughput sequence data from 10 Western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus. Compared to the human genetic map, broad-scale recombination rates tend to be conserved, but with exceptions, particularly in regions of chromosomal rearrangements and around the site of ancestral fusion in human chromosome 2. At fine scales, chimpanzee recombination is dominated by hotspots, which show no overlap with those of humans even though rates are similarly elevated around CpG islands and decreased within genes. The hotspot-specifying protein PRDM9 shows extensive variation among Western chimpanzees, and there is little evidence that any sequence motifs are enriched in hotspots. The contrasting locations of hotspots provide a natural experiment, which demonstrates the impact of recombination on base composition.
Chimpanzees show similar genetic recombination rates as humans but differ in the genomic regions involved.

	abstract = {Recombination between homologous, but non-allelic, stretches of DNA such as gene families, segmental duplications and repeat elements is an important source of mutation. In humans, recent studies have identified short DNA motifs that both determine the location of 40 per cent of meiotic cross-over hotspots and are significantly enriched at the breakpoints of recurrent non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) syndromes. Unexpectedly, the most highly penetrant form of the motif occurs on the background of an inactive repeat element family (THE1 elements) and the motif also has strong recombinogenic activity on currently active element families including Alu and LINE2 elements. Analysis of genetic variation among members of these repeat families indicates an important role for NAHR in their evolution. Given the potential for double-strand breaks within repeat DNA to cause pathological rearrangement, the association between repeats and hotspots is surprising. Here we consider possible explanations for why selection acting against NAHR has not eliminated hotspots from repeat DNA including mechanistic constraints, possible benefits to repeat DNA from recruiting hotspots and rapid evolution of the recombination machinery. I suggest that rapid evolution of hotspot motifs may, surprisingly, tend to favour sequences present in repeat DNA and outline the data required to differentiate between hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Large GWAS have identified tens or even hundreds of common SNPs significantly associated with individual complex diseases; however, these SNPs typically explain a small proportion of phenotypic variance. Recently, heritability analyses based on GWAS data suggest that common SNPs have the potential to explain substantially larger fraction of phenotypic variance and to improve the genetic risk prediction. Because of the polygenic nature, improving genetic risk prediction for complex diseases typically requires substantially increasing the sample size in the discovery set. Thus, it is crucial to develop more efficient algorithms using existing GWAS summary data. In this article, we extend the polygenic risk score (PRS) method by adjusting the marginal effect size of SNPs for winner’s curse and by incorporating external functional annotation data. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies show that the performance improvement depends on the genetic architecture of the trait, sample size of the discovery sample set and the degree of enrichment of association for SNPs annotated as “high-prior” and the linkage disequilibrium patterns of these SNPs. We applied our method to the summary data of 14 GWAS. Our method achieved 25–50\% gain in efficiency (measured in the prediction R2) for 5 of 14 diseases compared to the standard PRS.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The majority of plants, animals and fungi reproduce sexually, which has a profound effect on patterns of genetic diversity. For sexual reproduction to occur a specialized cell division called meiosis generates gametes (sex cells) with recombined DNA. During meiosis homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal exchange of genetic material called crossover, which mixes parental sequences. Crossover frequency is highly variable along chromosomes and is typically concentrated in narrow regions called hotspots. Sexual reproduction is proposed to provide a major advantage during host-pathogen coevolution. This theory predicts that crossover hotspots will be associated with genes that play important roles in the immune system, where diversity may be beneficial. To investigate this idea we mapped patterns of crossover frequency in relation to genes that plants use to recognize pathogens. We observe that a subset of Arabidopsis thaliana resistance genes overlap with strong crossover hotspots. However, we also observe resistance gene coldspots, which correlate with chromosomal rearrangements between varietal lines (ecotypes). Using Arabidopsis ecotypes we also show that natural genetic variation has a strong modifying effect on resistance gene cluster recombination rates. Together our work shows complex variation in resistance gene crossover patterns, which may relate to heterogeneity in coevolutionary pressures experienced at different loci, in addition to the effects of structural genetic diversity.},

Typically, studies for disease use a case-control (CC) design and studies for quantitative traits (QT) are population based. The question that we address is what is the equivalence between CC and QT association studies in terms of detection power and sample size? We compare the binary and continuous traits by assuming a threshold model for disease and assuming that the effect size on disease liability has similar feature as on QT. We derive the approximate ratio of the non-centrality parameter (NCP) between CC and QT association studies, which is determined by sample size, disease prevalence (K) and the proportion of cases (v) in the CC study. For disease with prevalence {\textless}0.1, CC association study with equal numbers of cases and controls (v=0.5) needs smaller sample size than QT association study to achieve equivalent power, e.g. a CC association study of schizophrenia (K=0.01) needs only ∼55\% sample size required for association study of height. So a planned meta-analysis for height on ∼120,000 individuals has power equivalent to a CC study on 33,100 schizophrenia cases and 33,100 controls, a size not yet achievable for this disease. With equal sample size, when v=K, the power of CC association study is much less than that of QT association study because of the information lost by transforming a quantitative continuous trait to a binary trait.

	abstract = {Recombination acts to shuffle the existing genetic variation within a population, leading to various approaches for detecting its action and estimating the rate at which it occurs. Here, we discuss the principal methodological and analytical approaches taken to understanding the distribution of recombination across the human genome. We first discuss the detection of recent crossover events in both well-characterised pedigrees and larger populations with extensive recent shared ancestry. We then describe approaches for learning about the fine-scale structure of recombination rate variation from patterns of genetic variation in unrelated individuals. Finally, we show how related approaches using individuals of admixed ancestry can provide an alternative approach to analysing recombination. Approaches differ not only in the statistical methods used, but also in the resolution of inference, the timescale over which recombination events are detected, and the extent to which inter-individual variation can be identified.},

We applied Eagle to N ≈ 150,000 samples (0.2\% of the British population) from the UK Biobank, and we determined that it is 1–2 orders of magnitude faster than existing methods while achieving similar or better phasing accuracy (switch error rate ≈ 0.3\%, corresponding to perfect phase in a majority of 10-Mb segments). We also observed that, when used within an imputation pipeline, Eagle prephasing improved downstream imputation accuracy in comparison to prephasing in batches using existing methods, as necessary to achieve comparable computational cost.},

	abstract = {Recombination: The birds and the yeast
Apes and mice have a specific gene, PRDM9, that is associated with genomic regions with high rates of recombination, called hotspots. In species with PRDM9, hotspots move rapidly within the genome, varying among populations and closely related species (see the Perspective by Lichten). To investigate recombination hotspots in species lacking PRDM9, Singhal et al. examined bird genomes, which lack a PRDM9 gene. They looked closely at the genomes of finch species and found that recombination was localized to the promoter regions of genes and highly conserved over millions of years. Similarly, Lam and Keeney examined recombination localization within yeast, which also lacks PRDM9. They found a similar more-or-less fixed pattern of hotspots. Thus, recombination in species lacking a PRDM9 gene shows similar patterns of hotspot localization and evolution.
Science, this issue p. 913, p. 928; see also p. 932
The DNA-binding protein PRDM9 has a critical role in specifying meiotic recombination hotspots in mice and apes, but it appears to be absent from other vertebrate species, including birds. To study the evolution and determinants of recombination in species lacking the gene that encodes PRDM9, we inferred fine-scale genetic maps from population resequencing data for two bird species: the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, and the long-tailed finch, Poephila acuticauda. We found that both species have recombination hotspots, which are enriched near functional genomic elements. Unlike in mice and apes, most hotspots are shared between the two species, and their conservation seems to extend over tens of millions of years. These observations suggest that in the absence of PRDM9, recombination targets functional features that both enable access to the genome and constrain its evolution.
DNA recombination hotspots in birds are localized to gene regulatory sequences and show evolutionary conservation. [Also see Perspective by Lichten]

	abstract = {Neuroticism is a risk factor for selected mental and physical illnesses and is inversely associated with intelligence. Intelligence appears to interact with neuroticism and mitigate its detrimental effects on physical health and mortality. However, the inter-ralationships of neuroticism and intelligence for major depressive disorder (MDD) and psychological distress has not been well examined. Associations and interactions between neuroticism and general intelligence (g) on MDD and psychological distress were examined in two population-based cohorts: Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS, N=19,200) and UK Biobank (N=90,529). The Eysenck Personality Scale Short Form-Revised measured neuroticism and g was extracted from multiple cognitive ability tests in each cohort. Family structure was adjusted for in GS:SFHS. Neuroticism was associated with MDD and psychological distress in both samples. A significant interaction between neuroticism and g in predicting MDD status was found in UK Biobank (OR = 0.96, p {\textless} .01), suggesting that higher g ameliorated the adverse effects of neuroticism on the likelihood of having MDD. This interaction was not found in GS:SFHS. In both samples, higher neuroticism and lower intelligence were associated with increased psychological distress. A significant interaction was also found in both cohorts (GS:SFHS: β = -0.05, p {\textless} .01; UK Biobank: β = -0.02, p {\textless} .01), such that intelligence protected against the deleterious effect of neuroticism on psychological distress. From two large cohort studies, our findings suggest intelligence acts a protective factor in mitigating the effects of neuroticism on risk for depressive illness and psychological distress.},

Using long-lived smokers as a phenotype (n = 90)—a group whose survival may signify innate resilience—we conducted a genome-wide association study comparing them to smokers at ages 52–69 (n = 730). These results were used to conduct a functional interaction network and pathway analysis, to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms that collectively related to smokers’ longevity. We identified a set of 215 single nucleotide polymorphisms (all of which had p {\textless}5×10−3 in the genome-wide association study) that were located within genes making-up a functional interaction network. These single nucleotide polymorphisms were then used to create a weighted polygenic risk score that, using an independent validation sample of nonsmokers (N = 6,447), was found to be significantly associated with a 22\% increase in the likelihood of being aged 90–99 (n = 253) and an over threefold increase in the likelihood of being a centenarian (n = 4), compared with being at ages 52–79 (n = 4,900). Additionally, the polygenic risk score was also associated with an 11\% reduction in cancer prevalence over up to 18 years (odds ratio: 0.89, p = .011). Overall, using a unique phenotype and incorporating prior knowledge of biological networks, this study identified a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms that together appear to be important for human aging, stress resistance, cancer, and longevity.},

We identify 3 variants associated with subjective well-being, 2 variants associated with depressive symptoms, and 11 variants associated with neuroticism, including 2 inversion polymorphisms. The two loci associated with depressive symptoms replicate in an independent depression sample. Joint analyses that exploit the high genetic correlations between the phenotypes ({\textbar}ρˆ{\textbar} ≈ 0.8) strengthen the overall credibility of the findings and allow us to identify additional variants. Across our phenotypes, loci regulating expression in central nervous system and adrenal or pancreas tissues are strongly enriched for association.},

The ability of such “genetic profiles” to predict outcome is usually quantified in an independent data set. Coefficients of determination (R2) have been a useful measure to quantify the goodness-of-fit of the genetic profile. Various pseudo-R2 measures for binary responses have been proposed. However, there is no standard or consensus measure because the concept of residual variance is not easily defined on the observed probability scale. Unlike other nongenetic predictors such as environmental exposure, there is prior information on genetic predictors because for most traits there are estimates of the proportion of variation in risk in the population due to all genetic factors, the heritability. It is this useful ability to benchmark that makes the choice of a measure of goodness-of-fit in genetic profiling different from that of nongenetic predictors. In this study, we use a liability threshold model to establish the relationship between the observed probability scale and underlying liability scale in measuring R2 for binary responses. We show that currently used R2 measures are difficult to interpret, biased by ascertainment, and not comparable to heritability. We suggest a novel and globally standard measure of R2 that is interpretable on the liability scale. Furthermore, even when using ascertained case-control studies that are typical in human disease studies, we can obtain an R2 measure on the liability scale that can be compared directly to heritability.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Recently many genetic variants have been established for diseases, and the findings have raised hope for risk prediction based on genomic profiles. However, we need to have proper statistical measures to assess the usefulness of such tests. In this study, we developed a statistical framework which enables us to evaluate many predictive indices analytically. It is based on the liability threshold model, which postulates a latent liability that is normally distributed. Affected individuals are assumed to have a liability exceeding a certain threshold. We demonstrated that, given the overall disease probability and variance in liability explained by the genetic markers, we can compute a variety of predictive indices. An example is the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, or AUC, which is very commonly employed. However, the limitations of AUC are often ignored, and we proposed complementing it with other indices. We have therefore also computed other metrics like the average difference in risks between cases and non-cases, the ability of reclassification into high- and low-risk categories, and the proportion of cases accounted for by a certain percentile of population at the highest risk. We also derived how to construct graphs showing the risk distribution in population.},

We identified several genes and pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid.

We use a linear mixed model for analysis of binary traits and transform the estimates to a liability scale by adjusting both for scale and for ascertainment of the case samples. We show by theory and simulation that the method is unbiased. We apply the method to data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and show that a substantial proportion of variation in liability for Crohn disease, bipolar disorder, and type I diabetes is tagged by common SNPs.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
Genome-wide measures of gene expression can identify patterns of gene activity that subclassify tumours and might provide a better means than is currently available for individual risk assessment in patients with lymph-node-negative breast cancer.
Methods
We analysed, with Affymetrix Human U133a GeneChips, the expression of 22 000 transcripts from total RNA of frozen tumour samples from 286 lymph-node-negative patients who had not received adjuvant systemic treatment.
Findings
In a training set of 115 tumours, we identified a 76-gene signature consisting of 60 genes for patients positive for oestrogen receptors (ER) and 16 genes for ER-negative patients. This signature showed 93\% sensitivity and 48\% specificity in a subsequent independent testing set of 171 lymph-node-negative patients. The gene profile was highly informative in identifying patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years (hazard ratio 5·67 [95\% CI 2·59–12·4]), even when corrected for traditional prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (5·55 [2·46–12·5]). The 76-gene profile also represented a strong prognostic factor for the development of metastasis in the subgroups of 84 premenopausal patients (9·60 [2·28–40·5]), 87 postmenopausal patients (4·04 [1·57–10·4]), and 79 patients with tumours of 10–20 mm (14·1 [3·34–59·2]), a group of patients for whom prediction of prognosis is especially difficult.
Interpretation
The identified signature provides a powerful tool for identification of patients at high risk of distant recurrence. The ability to identify patients who have a favourable prognosis could, after independent confirmation, allow clinicians to avoid adjuvant systemic therapy or to choose less aggressive therapeutic options.},

	abstract = {Background: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy)., Methods: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger’s test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables., Results: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples., Conclusions: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

	abstract = {Background—Danon disease is an X-linked disorder that leads to fatal cardiomyopathy, caused by a deficiency in lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2). In female patients, a later-onset and less severe clinical phenotype have been attributed to the random inactivation of the X-chromosome carrying the mutant diseased allele. We generated a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) based model of Danon disease to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Xi-chromosome reactivation using a DNA methylation inhibitor.
Methods—Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation (c.520C{\textgreater}T, exon 4) of the LAMP2 gene in a family with Danon disease. We generated iPSC lines from somatic cells derived from the affected mother and her two sons, and then differentiated them into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) for modelling the histological and functional signatures, including autophagy failure of Danon disease.
Results—Our iPSC-CM platform provides evidence that random inactivation of the wildtype and mutant LAMP2 alleles on the X-chromosome is responsible for the unusual phenotype in female patients with Danon disease. In-vitro, iPSC-CMs from these patients reproduced the histological features and autophagy failure of Danon disease. Finally, administration of DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated the silent LAMP2 allele in iPSCs and iPSC-CMs in female patients with Danon disease, and ameliorated their autophagy failure, supporting the application of a patient specific-iPSC platform for disease modeling and drug screening.
Conclusions—Our iPSC-CM platform provides novel mechanistic and therapeutic insights into the contribution of random X-chromosome inactivation to disease phenotype in X-linked Danon disease.},

With the next generation sequencing technology, it is relatively easier to obtain a set of paired-end short reads from an individual (the donor). By aligning these reads onto a reference genome (the reference), we are able to detect some of the structural variations that exist between the donor and the reference. A number of tools were developed in this direction. However, these tools are not able to detect all types of variations. In particular, they do not perform well for the detection of tandem duplications which are found to be associated with some diseases. In this paper, we try to solve this problem and developed algorithm to identify novel tandem duplications that exist in donor and vice versa. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets showed that our solutions are effective.},

	abstract = {The vast majority of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are performed in Europeans, and their transferability to other populations is dependent on many factors (e.g., linkage disequilibrium, allele frequencies, genetic architecture). As medical genomics studies become increasingly large and diverse, gaining insights into population history and consequently the transferability of disease risk measurement is critical. Here, we disentangle recent population history in the widely used 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, with an emphasis on populations underrepresented in medical studies. To examine the transferability of single-ancestry GWASs, we used published summary statistics to calculate polygenic risk scores for eight well-studied phenotypes. We identify directional inconsistencies in all scores; for example, height is predicted to decrease with genetic distance from Europeans, despite robust anthropological evidence that West Africans are as tall as Europeans on average. To gain deeper quantitative insights into GWAS transferability, we developed a complex trait coalescent-based simulation framework considering effects of polygenicity, causal allele frequency divergence, and heritability. As expected, correlations between true and inferred risk are typically highest in the population from which summary statistics were derived. We demonstrate that scores inferred from European GWASs are biased by genetic drift in other populations even when choosing the same causal variants and that biases in any direction are possible and unpredictable. This work cautions that summarizing findings from large-scale GWASs may have limited portability to other populations using standard approaches and highlights the need for generalized risk prediction methods and the inclusion of more diverse individuals in medical genomics.},

	abstract = {Achieving accurate genomic estimated breeding values for dairy cattle requires a very large reference population of genotyped and phenotyped individuals. Assembling such reference populations has been achieved for breeds such as Holstein, but is challenging for breeds with fewer individuals. An alternative is to use a multi-breed reference population, such that smaller breeds gain some advantage in accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) from information from larger breeds. However, this requires that marker-quantitative trait loci associations persist across breeds. Here, we assessed the gain in accuracy of GEBV in Jersey cattle as a result of using a combined Holstein and Jersey reference population, with either 39,745 or 624,213 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The surrogate used for accuracy was the correlation of GEBV with daughter trait deviations in a validation population. Two methods were used to predict breeding values, either a genomic BLUP (GBLUP\_mod), or a new method, BayesR, which used a mixture of normal distributions as the prior for SNP effects, including one distribution that set SNP effects to zero. The GBLUP\_mod method scaled both the genomic relationship matrix and the additive relationship matrix to a base at the time the breeds diverged, and regressed the genomic relationship matrix to account for sampling errors in estimating relationship coefficients due to a finite number of markers, before combining the 2 matrices. Although these modifications did result in less biased breeding values for Jerseys compared with an unmodified genomic relationship matrix, BayesR gave the highest accuracies of GEBV for the 3 traits investigated (milk yield, fat yield, and protein yield), with an average increase in accuracy compared with GBLUP\_mod across the 3 traits of 0.05 for both Jerseys and Holsteins. The advantage was limited for either Jerseys or Holsteins in using 624,213 SNP rather than 39,745 SNP (0.01 for Holsteins and 0.03 for Jerseys, averaged across traits). Even this limited and nonsignificant advantage was only observed when BayesR was used. An alternative panel, which extracted the SNP in the transcribed part of the bovine genome from the 624,213 SNP panel (to give 58,532 SNP), performed better, with an increase in accuracy of 0.03 for Jerseys across traits. This panel captures much of the increased genomic content of the 624,213 SNP panel, with the advantage of a greatly reduced number of SNP effects to estimate. Taken together, using this panel, a combined breed reference and using BayesR rather than GBLUP\_mod increased the accuracy of GEBV in Jerseys from 0.43 to 0.52, averaged across the 3 traits.},

We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation.

We argue that the classical definition of unbiasedness is not useful in this context and propose to use a different definition of unbiasedness that is a property of the estimator we advocate. We suggest an integrated approach to the estimation of the SNP effects and to the prediction of trait values, treating SNP effects as random instead of fixed effects. Statistical methods traditionally used in the prediction of trait values in the genetics of livestock, which predates the availability of SNP data, can be applied to analysis of GWAS, giving better estimates of the SNP effects and predictions of phenotypic and genetic values in individuals.},

Improvements in polygenic modeling will help improve our understanding of this relationship and could ultimately lead to, for example, changes in clinical practice in humans or better breeding/mating strategies in agricultural programs. Polygenic models present important challenges, both at the modeling/statistical level (what modeling assumptions produce the best results) and at the computational level (how should these models be effectively fit to data). We develop novel approaches to help tackle both these challenges, and we demonstrate the gains in accuracy that result in both simulated and real data examples.},

	abstract = {We consider applying Bayesian Variable Selection Regression, or BVSR, to genome-wide association studies and similar large-scale regression problems. Currently, typical genome-wide association studies measure hundreds of thousands, or millions, of genetic variants (SNPs), in thousands or tens of thousands of individuals, and attempt to identify regions harboring SNPs that affect some phenotype or outcome of interest. This goal can naturally be cast as a variable selection regression problem, with the SNPs as the covariates in the regression. Characteristic features of genome-wide association studies include the following: (i) a focus primarily on identifying relevant variables, rather than on prediction; and (ii) many relevant covariates may have tiny effects, making it effectively impossible to confidently identify the complete “correct” subset of variables. Taken together, these factors put a premium on having interpretable measures of confidence for individual covariates being included in the model, which we argue is a strength of BVSR compared with alternatives such as penalized regression methods. Here we focus primarily on analysis of quantitative phenotypes, and on appropriate prior specification for BVSR in this setting, emphasizing the idea of considering what the priors imply about the total proportion of variance in outcome explained by relevant covariates. We also emphasize the potential for BVSR to estimate this proportion of variance explained, and hence shed light on the issue of “missing heritability” in genome-wide association studies. More generally, we demonstrate that, despite the apparent computational challenges, BVSR can provide useful inferences in these large-scale problems, and in our simulations produces better power and predictive performance compared with standard single-SNP analyses and the penalized regression method LASSO. Methods described here are implemented in a software package, pi-MASS, available from the Guan Lab website http://bcm.edu/cnrc/mcmcmc/pimass.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite evidence from twin and family studies for an important contribution of genetic factors to both childhood and adult onset psychiatric disorders, identifying robustly associated specific DNA variants has proved challenging. In the pregenomics era the genetic architecture (number, frequency and effect size of risk variants) of complex genetic disorders was unknown. Empirical evidence for the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders is emerging from the genetic studies of the last 5 years.
METHODS AND SCOPE: We review the methods investigating the polygenic nature of complex disorders. We provide mini-guides to genomic profile (or polygenic) risk scoring and to estimation of variance (or heritability) from common SNPs; a glossary of key terms is also provided. We review results of applications of the methods to psychiatric disorders and related traits and consider how these methods inform on missing heritability, hidden heritability and still-missing heritability.
FINDINGS: Genome-wide genotyping and sequencing studies are providing evidence that psychiatric disorders are truly polygenic, that is they have a genetic architecture of many genetic variants, including risk variants that are both common and rare in the population. Sample sizes published to date are mostly underpowered to detect effect sizes of the magnitude presented by nature, and these effect sizes may be constrained by the biological validity of the diagnostic constructs.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the sample size for genome wide association studies of psychiatric disorders will lead to the identification of more associated genetic variants, as already found for schizophrenia. These loci provide the starting point of functional analyses that might eventually lead to new prevention and treatment options and to improved biological validity of diagnostic constructs. Polygenic analyses will contribute further to our understanding of complex genetic traits as sample sizes increase and as sample resources become richer in phenotypic descriptors, both in terms of clinical symptoms and of nongenetic risk factors.},

	abstract = {Over several decades, various forms of genomic analysis of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been extremely successful in picking up many disease associations. This is to be expected, as the MHC region is one of the most gene-dense and polymorphic stretches of human DNA. It also encodes proteins critical to immunity, including several controlling antigen processing and presentation. Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) imputation now permit the screening of large sample sets, a technique further facilitated by high-throughput sequencing. These methods promise to yield more precise contributions of MHC variants to disease. However, interpretation of MHC-disease associations in terms of the functions of variants has been problematic. Most studies confirm the paramount importance of class I and class II molecules, which are key to resistance to infection. Infection is likely driving the extreme variation of these genes across the human population, but this has been difficult to demonstrate. In contrast, many associations with autoimmune conditions have been shown to be specific to certain class I and class II alleles. Interestingly, conditions other than infections and autoimmunity are also associated with the MHC, including some cancers and neuropathies. These associations could be indirect, owing, for example, to the infectious history of a particular individual and selective pressures operating at the population level.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Recently there has been much interest in combining multiple genetic markers into a single score for predicting disease risk. Even if many of the individual markers have no detected effect, the combined score could be a strong predictor of disease. This has allowed researchers to demonstrate that some diseases have a strong genetic basis, even if few actual genes have been identified, and it has also revealed a common genetic basis for distinct diseases. These analyses have so far been performed opportunistically, with mixed results. Here I derive formulae based on the heritability of disease and size of the study, allowing researchers to plan their analyses from a more informed position. I show that discouraging results in some previous studies were due to the low number of subjects studied, but a modest increase in study size would allow more successful analysis. However, I also show that, for genetics to become useful for predicting individual risk of disease, hundreds of thousands of subjects may be needed to estimate the gene effects. This is larger than most existing studies, but will become more common in the near future, so that gene scores will become more useful for predicting disease than has appeared to date.},

Methodologies in this area include polygenic scoring, linear mixed models, and linkage disequilibrium scoring. They have been used to establish a polygenic effect, estimate genetic correlation between traits, estimate how many variants affect a trait, stratify cases into subphenotypes, predict individual disease risks, and infer causal effects using Mendelian randomization.

All existing methods require time cost O(MN2) (where N is the number of samples and M is the number of SNPs) and implicitly assume an infinitesimal genetic architecture in which effect sizes are normally distributed, which can limit power. Here we present a far more efficient mixed-model association method, BOLT-LMM, which requires only a small number of O(MN) time iterations and increases power by modeling more realistic, non-infinitesimal genetic architectures via a Bayesian mixture prior on marker effect sizes. We applied BOLT-LMM to 9 quantitative traits in 23,294 samples from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS) and observed significant increases in power, consistent with simulations.

	abstract = {Population structure, including population stratification and cryptic relatedness, can cause spurious associations in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Usually, the scaled median or mean test statistic for association calculated from multiple single-nucleotide-polymorphisms across the genome is used to assess such effects, and ‘genomic control’ can be applied subsequently to adjust test statistics at individual loci by a genomic inflation factor. Published GWAS have clearly shown that there are many loci underlying genetic variation for a wide range of complex diseases and traits, implying that a substantial proportion of the genome should show inflation of the test statistic. Here, we show by theory, simulation and analysis of data that in the absence of population structure and other technical artefacts, but in the presence of polygenic inheritance, substantial genomic inflation is expected. Its magnitude depends on sample size, heritability, linkage disequilibrium structure and the number of causal variants. Our predictions are consistent with empirical observations on height in independent samples of {\textasciitilde}4000 and {\textasciitilde}133 000 individuals.},

In this article, we investigate the power of QTL linkage and association analyses for simple random sibship samples, under the variance-components model proposed by Fulker et al. After a brief description of an extension of this variance-components model, we show that the powers of both linkage and association analyses are crucially dependent on the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to the QTL. The main difference between the two tests is that, whereas the power of association is directly related to the QTL heritability, the power of linkage is related more closely to the square of the QTL heritability. We also describe both how the power of linkage is attenuated by incomplete linkage and incomplete marker information and how the power of association is attenuated by incomplete linkage disequilibrium.},

We have developed an approach, LD Score regression, that quantifies the contribution of each by examining the relationship between test statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD). The LD Score regression intercept can be used to estimate a more powerful and accurate correction factor than genomic control.

Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance to schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia.},

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of simulated and real data using lasso and elastic-net penalized support-vector machine models, a mixed-effects linear model, a polygenic score, and unpenalized logistic regression. In simulation, the sparse penalized models achieved lower false-positive rates and higher precision than the other methods for detecting causal SNPs. The common practice of prefiltering SNP lists for subsequent penalized modeling was examined and shown to substantially reduce the ability to recover the causal SNPs. Using genome-wide SNP profiles across eight complex diseases within cross-validation, lasso and elastic-net models achieved substantially better predictive ability in celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and Crohn's disease, and had equivalent predictive ability in the rest, with the results in celiac disease strongly replicating between independent datasets. We investigated the effect of linkage disequilibrium on the predictive models, showing that the penalized methods leverage this information to their advantage, compared with methods that assume SNP independence. Our findings show that sparse penalized approaches are robust across different disease architectures, producing as good as or better phenotype predictions and variance explained. This has fundamental ramifications for the selection and future development of methods to genetically predict human disease.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

Recently, a number of technical hurdles have been described that add to a reluctance of including chromosome X in a GWAS, including complications in genotype calling, imputation, and selection of test statistics. To overcome this, we provide a “how to” guide for analyzing X chromosomal data within a standard GWAS. Following a general pipeline for GWAS, we highlight the steps in which the X chromosome requires specific attention, and we give tentative advice for each of these. Through this, we show that by selection of sensible algorithms and parameter settings, the inclusion of chromosome X in GWAS is manageable. Closing this gap is expected to further elucidate the genetic background of complex diseases, especially of those with sex-specific features.},

However, the impact of sedentariness on adiposity may be in part determined by a person’s genetic constitution. The specific genetic variants that are sensitive to physical activity and regulate adiposity remain largely unknown. Here, we aimed to identify genetic variants whose effects on adiposity are modified by physical activity by examining {\textasciitilde}2.5 million genetic variants in up to 200,452 individuals. We also tested whether adjusting for physical activity as a covariate could lead to the identification of novel adiposity variants. We find robust evidence of interaction with physical activity for the strongest known obesity risk-locus in the FTO gene, of which the body mass index-increasing effect is attenuated by {\textasciitilde}30\% in physically active individuals compared to inactive individuals. Our analyses indicate that other similar gene-physical activity interactions may exist, but better measurement of physical activity, larger sample sizes, and/or improved analytical methods will be required to identify them. Adjusting for physical activity, we identify 11 novel adiposity variants, suggesting that accounting for physical activity or other environmental factors that contribute to variation in adiposity may facilitate gene discovery.},

	abstract = {Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P {\textless} 5 × 10−8), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for {\textasciitilde}2.7\% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {\textgreater}20\% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},

Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations.

	abstract = {Autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases present a major burden to human health and are frequently associated with loci in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Here, we report a high-resolution (1.9 kb) linkage-disequilibrium (LD) map of a 4.46-Mb fragment containing the MHC in U.S. pedigrees with northern and western European ancestry collected by the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) and the first generation of haplotype tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) that provide up to a fivefold increase in genotyping efficiency for all future MHC-linked disease-association studies. The data confirm previously identified recombination hotspots in the class II region and allow the prediction of numerous novel hotspots in the class I and class III regions. The region of longest LD maps outside the classic MHC to the extended class I region spanning the MHC-linked olfactory-receptor gene cluster. The extended haplotype homozygosity analysis for recent positive selection shows that all 14 outlying haplotype variants map to a single extended haplotype, which most commonly bears HLA-DRB1*1501. The SNP data, haplotype blocks, and tagSNPs analysis reported here have been entered into a multidimensional Web-based database (GLOVAR), where they can be accessed and viewed in the context of relevant genome annotation. This LD map allowed us to give coordinates for the extremely variable LD structure underlying the MHC.},

	abstract = {The nature and scale of recombination rate variation are largely unknown for most species. In humans, pedigree analysis has documented variation at the chromosomal level, and sperm studies have identified specific hotspots in which crossing-over events cluster. To address whether this picture is representative of the genome as a whole, we have developed and validated a method for estimating recombination rates from patterns of genetic variation. From extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism surveys in European and African populations, we find evidence for extreme local rate variation spanning four orders in magnitude, in which 50\% of all recombination events take place in less than 10\% of the sequence. We demonstrate that recombination hotspots are a ubiquitous feature of the human genome, occurring on average every 200 kilobases or less, but recombination occurs preferentially outside genes.
Patterns of sequence variation show that half of the genetic recombination within the human genome occurs in only 10\% of the sequence.

The two quantities of interest are R, the number of recombination events in the history of a sample of sequences, and RM, the number of recombination events that can be parsimoniously inferred from a sample of sequences. Formulas are derived for the mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the number of recombination events may be greatly under-estimated in a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The statistic RM can be used to estimate the product of the recombination rate and the population size or, if the recombination rate is known, to estimate the population size. To illustrate this, DNA sequences from the Adh region of Drosophila melanogaster are used to estimate the effective population size of this species.},

In addition, properties of a maximum-likelihood estimator of the recombination parameter based on independent linked pairs of sites are obtained. A composite-likelihood estimator, for more than two linked sites, is also examined and found to work as well, or better, than other available ad hoc estimators. Linkage disequilibrium in the Xq28 and Xq25 region of humans is analyzed in a sample of Europeans (CEPH).

Hyperconnectivity in the default mode network has been associated with psychopathology, but psychedelic serotonin agonists like psilocybin may profoundly disrupt these dysfunctional neural network circuits and provide a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders. We have reviewed the current literature to investigate the efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. There were seven clinical trials that investigated psilocybin-assisted therapy as a treatment for psychiatric disorders related to anxiety, depression, and substance use. All trials demonstrated reductions in psychiatric rating scale scores or increased response and remission rates. There were large effect sizes related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. Psilocybin may also potentially reduce alcohol or tobacco use and increase abstinence rates in addiction, but the benefits of these two trials were less clear due to open-label study designs without statistical analysis. Psilocybin-assisted therapy efficacy and safety appear promising, but more robust clinical trials will be required to support FDA approval and identify the potential role in clinical psychiatry.},

The first approach, which is due to Golding, is to include additional probabilities in the system that allow some members of the sample to be specified at only one locus. The second approach, which is new, considers the joint distribution of the sample configuration and the number of recombination events since the time of the most recent common ancestor. The first approach is used for numerical computation, whereas the second approach is used to derive a two-locus version of Hoppe's urn model. The latter permits efficient simulation of the two-locus sampling distribution, provided the recombination parameter is not too large.},

	abstract = {The sampling distributions of several statistics that measure the association of alleles on gametes (linkage disequilibrium) are estimated under a two-locus neutral infinite allele model using an efficient Monte Carlo method. An often used approximation for the mean squared linkage disequilibrium is shown to be inaccurate unless the proper statistical conditioning is used. The joint distribution of linkage disequilibrium and the allele frequencies in the sample is studied. This estimated joint distribution is sufficient for obtaining an approximate maximum likelihood estimate of C = 4Nc, where N is the population size and c is the recombination rate. It has been suggested that observations of high linkage disequilibrium might be a good basis for rejecting a neutral model in favor of a model in which natural selection maintains genetic variation. It is found that a single sample of chromosomes, examined at two loci cannot provide sufficient information for such a test if C {\textless} 10, because with C this small, very high levels of linkage disequilibrium are not unexpected under the neutral model. In samples of size 50, it is found that, even when C is as large as 50, the distribution of linkage disequilibrium conditional on the allele frequencies is substantially different from the distribution when there is no linkage between the loci. When conditioned on the number of alleles at each locus in the sample, all of the sample statistics examined are nearly independent of λ = 4Nμ, where μ is the neutral mutation rate.},

It is assumed that the population consists of N diploid, randomly mating individuals, that each of the two loci mutate according to the infinite allele model at a rate µ and that the population is at equilibrium. When 4Nµ is small, the most probable samples of gametes are those that segregate only two alleles at either locus. The probabilities of various samples of gametes are discussed. The results show that most samples with completely linked loci have either a very small or a very large association between the alleles of each locus. This causes the distribution of linkage disequilibrium to be skewed and the distribution of the correlation coefficient to be bimodal. The correlation coefficient is commonly used as a test statistic with a chi square distribution and yet has a bimodal distribution when the loci are completely linked. Thus, such a test is not likely to be accurate unless the rate of recombination between the loci and/or the effective population size are sufficiently large enough so that the loci can be treated as unlinked.},

The statistical significance, as expressed in a P-value, is calculated as the fraction of permutation values that are at least as extreme as the original statistic, which was derived from non-permuted data. This empirical method directly couples both the minimal obtainable P-value and the resolution of the P-value to the number of permutations. Thereby, it imposes upon itself the need for a very large number of permutations when small P-values are to be accurately estimated. This is computationally expensive and often infeasible., Results: A method of computing P-values based on tail approximation is presented. The tail of the distribution of permutation values is approximated by a generalized Pareto distribution. A good fit and thus accurate P-value estimates can be obtained with a drastically reduced number of permutations when compared with the standard empirical way of computing P-values., Availability: The Matlab code can be obtained from the corresponding author on request., Contact: tknijnenburg@systemsbiology.org, Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We circumvent these difficulties by introducing a technique—cross-trait LD Score regression—for estimating genetic correlation that requires only GWAS summary statistics and is not biased by sample overlap. We use this method to estimate 276 genetic correlations among 24 traits. The results include genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia, anorexia and obesity, and educational attainment and several diseases. These results highlight the power of genome-wide analyses, as there currently are no significantly associated SNPs for anorexia nervosa and only three for educational attainment.},

	abstract = {Several methods have been proposed to estimate the variance in disease liability explained by large sets of genetic markers. However, current methods do not scale up well to large sample sizes. Linear mixed models require solving high-dimensional matrix equations, and methods that use polygenic scores are very computationally intensive. Here we propose a fast analytic method that uses polygenic scores, based on the formula for the non-centrality parameter of the association test of the score. We estimate model parameters from the results of multiple polygenic score tests based on markers with p values in different intervals. We estimate parameters by maximum likelihood and use profile likelihood to compute confidence intervals. We compare various options for constructing polygenic scores, based on nested or disjoint intervals of p values, weighted or unweighted effect sizes, and different numbers of intervals, in estimating the variance explained by a set of markers, the proportion of markers with effects, and the genetic covariance between a pair of traits. Our method provides nearly unbiased estimates and confidence intervals with good coverage, although estimation of the variance is less reliable when jointly estimated with the covariance. We find that disjoint p value intervals perform better than nested intervals, but the weighting did not affect our results. A particular advantage of our method is that it can be applied to summary statistics from single markers, and so can be quickly applied to large consortium datasets. Our method, named AVENGEME (Additive Variance Explained and Number of Genetic Effects Method of Estimation), is implemented in R software.},

	abstract = {Permutation tests are increasingly being used as a reliable method for inference in neuroimaging analysis. However, they are computationally intensive. For small, non-imaging datasets, recomputing a model thousands of times is seldom a problem, but for large, complex models this can be prohibitively slow, even with the availability of inexpensive computing power. Here we exploit properties of statistics used with the general linear model (GLM) and their distributions to obtain accelerations irrespective of generic software or hardware improvements. We compare the following approaches: (i) performing a small number of permutations; (ii) estimating the p-value as a parameter of a negative binomial distribution; (iii) fitting a generalised Pareto distribution to the tail of the permutation distribution; (iv) computing p-values based on the expected moments of the permutation distribution, approximated from a gamma distribution; (v) direct fitting of a gamma distribution to the empirical permutation distribution; and (vi) permuting a reduced number of voxels, with completion of the remainder using low rank matrix theory. Using synthetic data we assessed the different methods in terms of their error rates, power, agreement with a reference result, and the risk of taking a different decision regarding the rejection of the null hypotheses (known as the resampling risk). We also conducted a re-analysis of a voxel-based morphometry study as a real-data example. All methods yielded exact error rates. Likewise, power was similar across methods. Resampling risk was higher for methods (i), (iii) and (v). For comparable resampling risks, the method in which no permutations are done (iv) was the absolute fastest. All methods produced visually similar maps for the real data, with stronger effects being detected in the family-wise error rate corrected maps by (iii) and (v), and generally similar to the results seen in the reference set. Overall, for uncorrected p-values, method (iv) was found the best as long as symmetric errors can be assumed. In all other settings, including for familywise error corrected p-values, we recommend the tail approximation (iii). The methods considered are freely available in the tool PALM — Permutation Analysis of Linear Models.,

We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 SNPs genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45\% of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.},

Here, we review the principles and applications of significance testing and power calculation, including recently proposed gene-based tests for rare variants.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Polygenic risk scores comprising established susceptibility variants have shown to be informative classifiers for several complex diseases including prostate cancer. For prostate cancer it is unknown if inclusion of genetic markers that have so far not been associated with prostate cancer risk at a genome-wide significant level will improve disease prediction.


METHODS

We built polygenic risk scores in a large training set comprising over 25,000 individuals. Initially 65 established prostate cancer susceptibility variants were selected. After LD pruning additional variants were prioritized based on their association with prostate cancer. Six-fold cross validation was performed to assess genetic risk scores and optimize the number of additional variants to be included. The final model was evaluated in an independent study population including 1,370 cases and 1,239 controls.


RESULTS

The polygenic risk score with 65 established susceptibility variants provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.67. Adding an additional 68 novel variants significantly increased the AUC to 0.68 (P = 0.0012) and the net reclassification index with 0.21 (P = 8.5E-08). All novel variants were located in genomic regions established as associated with prostate cancer risk.

Inclusion of additional genetic variants from established prostate cancer susceptibility regions improves disease prediction. Prostate 75:1467–1474, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Importance: Schizophrenia (SZ) has a complex, heterogeneous symptom presentation with limited established associations between biological markers and illness onset. Many (gene) molecular pathways (MPs) are enriched for SZ signal, but it is still unclear how these MPs, global PRS, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complement component (C4) gene expression, and MHC loci might jointly contribute to SZ and its clinical presentation. It is also unclear whether sex or ancestry interacts with these metrics to increase risk in certain individuals. Objective: To examine multiple genetic metrics, sex, and their interactions as possible predictors of SZ risk. Genetic information could aid in the clinical prediction of risk, but it is still unclear which genetic metrics are most promising, and how sex interacts with genetic risk metrics. Design, Setting, and Participants: To examine molecular risk in a proof-of-concept study, we used the Wellcome Trust case-control cohort and classified cases as a function of 1) polygenic risk score (PRS) for both whole genome and for 345 implicated molecular pathways, 2) predicted C4 expression, 3) SZ-relevant MHC loci, 4) sex, and 5) ancestry. Main Outcomes and Measures: PRSs, C4 expression, SZ-relevant MHC loci, sex, and ancestry as joint risk factors for SZ. Results: Recursive partitioning yielded 15 molecular risk classes and retained as significant psychosis classifiers only sex, genome-wide SZ polygenic risk, and one MP PRS. Sex was the most robust classifier in a stepwise regression, and there was a significant interaction of sex with SZ PRS on case status, suggesting males have a lower polygenic risk threshold. By down-sampling case proportion to 1\% and 1.4\% population base rates in males and females, respectively, high-risk subtypes defined by this model had roughly a 52\% odds of developing SZ (individuals with SZ PRS elevated by 2.6 SDs; incidence = 51.8\%). Conclusions and Relevance: This proof-of-concept suggests that global SZ PRS, sex, and their interaction are robust predictors of risk and that males have a lower PRS threshold for onset. Implications for the integration of these metrics with psychometrically-identified risk are discussed.},

We create a polygenic risk score that is significantly different between BP and SCZ and show a significant correlation between a BP polygenic risk score and the clinical dimension of mania in SCZ patients. Our results indicate that first, combining diseases with similar genetic risk profiles improves power to detect shared risk loci and second, that future direct comparisons of BP and SCZ are likely to identify loci with significant differential effects. Identifying these loci should aid in the fundamental understanding of how these diseases differ biologically. These findings also indicate that combining clinical symptom dimensions and polygenic signatures could provide additional information that may someday be used clinically.},

	abstract = {Background
Recent data provide strong support for a substantial common polygenic contribution (i.e. many alleles each of small effect) to genetic susceptibility for schizophrenia and overlapping susceptibility for bipolar disorder.
Aims
To test hypotheses about the relationship between schizophrenia and psychotic types of bipolar disorder.
Method
Using a polygenic score analysis to test whether schizophrenia polygenic risk alleles, en masse, significantly discriminate between individuals with bipolar disorder with and without psychotic features. The primary sample included 1829 participants with bipolar disorder and the replication sample comprised 506 people with bipolar disorder.
Results
The subset of participants with Research Diagnostic Criteria schizoaffective bipolar disorder (n = 277) were significantly discriminated from the remaining participants with bipolar disorder (n = 1552) in both the primary (P = 0.00059) and the replication data-sets (P = 0.0070). In contrast, those with psychotic bipolar disorder as a whole were not significantly different from those with non-psychotic bipolar disorder in either data-set.
Conclusions
Genetic susceptibility influences at least two major domains of psychopathological variation in the schizophrenia–bipolar disorder clinical spectrum: one that relates to expression of a ‘bipolar disorder-like’ phenotype and one that is associated with expression of ‘ schizophrenia-like’ psychotic symptoms.},

Genetic studies have identified 163 susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease, mostly shared between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We undertook the largest genotype association study, to date, in widely used clinical subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease with the goal of further understanding the biological relations between diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This study included patients from 49 centres in 16 countries in Europe, North America, and Australasia. We applied the Montreal classification system of inflammatory bowel disease subphenotypes to 34 819 patients (19 713 with Crohn's disease, 14 683 with ulcerative colitis) genotyped on the Immunochip array. We tested for genotype–phenotype associations across 156 154 genetic variants. We generated genetic risk scores by combining information from all known inflammatory bowel disease associations to summarise the total load of genetic risk for a particular phenotype. We used these risk scores to test the hypothesis that colonic Crohn's disease, ileal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis are all genetically distinct from each other, and to attempt to identify patients with a mismatch between clinical diagnosis and genetic risk profile.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}After quality control, the primary analysis included 29 838 patients (16 902 with Crohn's disease, 12 597 with ulcerative colitis). Three loci (\textit{NOD2, MHC}, and \textit{MST1} 3p21) were associated with subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease, mainly disease location (essentially fixed over time; median follow-up of 10·5 years). Little or no genetic association with disease behaviour (which changed dramatically over time) remained after conditioning on disease location and age at onset. The genetic risk score representing all known risk alleles for inflammatory bowel disease showed strong association with disease subphenotype (p=1·65 × 10$^{\textrm{−78}}$), even after exclusion of \textit{NOD2, MHC}, and 3p21 (p=9·23 × 10$^{\textrm{−18}}$). Predictive models based on the genetic risk score strongly distinguished colonic from ileal Crohn's disease. Our genetic risk score could also identify a small number of patients with discrepant genetic risk profiles who were significantly more likely to have a revised diagnosis after follow-up (p=6·8 × 10$^{\textrm{−4}}$).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Our data support a continuum of disorders within inflammatory bowel disease, much better explained by three groups (ileal Crohn's disease, colonic Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) than by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as currently defined. Disease location is an intrinsic aspect of a patient's disease, in part genetically determined, and the major driver to changes in disease behaviour over time.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium members funding sources (see Acknowledgments for full list).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

We used linkage disequilibrium regression and polygenic profile scoring to test for shared genetic aetiology between cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric disorders and physical health. Using information provided by many published genome-wide association study consortia, we created polygenic profile scores for 24 vascular–metabolic, neuropsychiatric, physiological–anthropometric and cognitive traits in the participants of UK Biobank, a very large population-based sample (N=112 151). Pleiotropy between cognitive and health traits was quantified by deriving genetic correlations using summary genome-wide association study statistics and to the method of linkage disequilibrium score regression. Substantial and significant genetic correlations were observed between cognitive test scores in the UK Biobank sample and many of the mental and physical health-related traits and disorders assessed here. In addition, highly significant associations were observed between the cognitive test scores in the UK Biobank sample and many polygenic profile scores, including coronary artery disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, autism, major depressive disorder, body mass index, intracranial volume, infant head circumference and childhood cognitive ability. Where disease diagnosis was available for UK Biobank participants, we were able to show that these results were not confounded by those who had the relevant disease. These findings indicate that a substantial level of pleiotropy exists between cognitive abilities and many human mental and physical health disorders and traits and that it can be used to predict phenotypic variance across samples.},

Such procedures, most notably the Bonferroni adjustment, suffer from the problem that error rate control cannot be localized to individual tests, and that these procedures do not distinguish between exploratory and/or data-driven testing vs. hypothesis-driven testing. Instead, procedures derived from limiting false discovery rates may be a more appealing method to control error rates in multiple tests. Controlling the false positive rate can lead to philosophical inconsistencies that can negatively impact the practice of reporting statistically significant findings. We demonstrate that the false discovery rate approach can overcome these inconsistencies and illustrate its benefit through an application to two recent health studies. The false discovery rate approach is more powerful than methods like the Bonferroni procedure that control false positive rates. Controlling the false discovery rate in a study that arguably consisted of scientifically driven hypotheses found nearly as many significant results as without any adjustment, whereas the Bonferroni procedure found no significant results. Although still unfamiliar to many health researchers, the use of false discovery rate control in the context of multiple testing can provide a solid basis for drawing conclusions about statistical significance.},

Even after correcting for general cognitive ability, numerous studies report a negative association between ADHD and educational achievement. With polygenic scores we examined whether genetic variants that have a positive influence on educational attainment have a protective effect against ADHD. The effect sizes from a large GWA meta-analysis of educational attainment in adults were used to calculate polygenic scores in an independent sample of 12-year-old children from the Netherlands Twin Register. Linear mixed models showed that the polygenic scores significantly predicted educational achievement, school performance, ADHD symptoms and attention problems in children. These results confirm the genetic overlap between ADHD and educational achievement, indicating that one way to gain insight into genetic variants responsible for variation in ADHD is to include data on educational achievement, which are available at a larger scale. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and autistic traits in the general population may share genetic susceptibility factors. In this study, we investigated such potential overlap based on common genetic variants. We developed and validated a self-report questionnaire of autistic traits in adults. We then conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of six trait scores derived from the questionnaire through exploratory factor analysis in 1981 adults from the general population. Using the results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS of ASDs, we observed genetic sharing between ASDs and the autistic traits 'childhood behavior', 'rigidity' and 'attention to detail'. Gene-set analysis subsequently identified 'rigidity' to be significantly associated with a network of ASD gene-encoded proteins that regulates neurite outgrowth. Gene-wide association with the well-established ASD gene MET reached significance. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for an overlapping genetic and biological etiology underlying ASDs and autistic population traits, which suggests that genetic studies in the general population may yield novel ASD genes.},

In a follow-up study (N=329,000), a new EduYears GPS explains up to 4\%. Here, we tested the association between this latest EduYears GPS and educational achievement scores at ages 7, 12 and 16 in an independent sample of 5825 UK individuals. We found that EduYears GPS explained greater amounts of variance in educational achievement over time, up to 9\% at age 16, accounting for 15\% of the heritable variance. This is the strongest GPS prediction to date for quantitative behavioral traits. Individuals in the highest and lowest GPS septiles differed by a whole school grade at age 16. Furthermore, EduYears GPS was associated with general cognitive ability ({\textasciitilde}3.5\%) and family socioeconomic status ({\textasciitilde}7\%). There was no evidence of an interaction between EduYears GPS and family socioeconomic status on educational achievement or on general cognitive ability. These results are a harbinger of future widespread use of GPS to predict genetic risk and resilience in the social and behavioral sciences.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is known for its substantial clinical and suspected causal heterogeneity. It is characterized by low mood, psychomotor slowing and increased levels of the personality trait neuroticism; factors also associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). It is possible that some cases of MDD may have a substantial genetic loading for SCZ. The presence of SCZ-like MDD subgroups would be indicated by an interaction between MDD status and polygenic risk of SCZ on cognitive, personality and mood measures. Here, we hypothesized that higher SCZ polygenic risk would define larger MDD case–control differences in cognitive ability, and smaller differences in distress and neuroticism. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for SCZ and their association with cognitive variables, neuroticism, mood and psychological distress were estimated in a large population-based cohort (Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study, GS:SFHS). The individuals were divided into those with, and without, depression (n=2587 and n=16 764, respectively) to test for the interactions between MDD status and schizophrenia risk. Replication was sought in UK Biobank (UKB; n=6049 and n=27 476 cases and controls, respectively). In both the cohorts, we found significant interactions between SCZ-PRS and MDD status for measures of psychological distress (βGS=−0.04, PGS=0.014 and βUKB=−0.09, PUKB0.001 for GS:SFHS and UKB, respectively) and neuroticism (βGS=−0.04, PGS=0.002 and βUKB=−0.06, PUKB=0.023). In both the cohorts, there was a reduction of case–control differences on a background of higher genetic risk of SCZ. These findings suggest that depression on a background of high genetic risk for SCZ may show attenuated associations with distress and neuroticism. This may represent a causally distinct form of MDD more closely related to SCZ.},

A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate ttt. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways.

Determining the significance of results in the face of testing a genomewide set of multiple hypotheses, most of which are producing noisy, null-distributed association signals, presents a challenge to the wide community of association researchers. Rather than each study engaging in independent evaluation of significance standards, we have undertaken the task of developing such standards for genomewide significance, based on data collected by the International Haplotype Map Consortium. We report an estimated testing burden of a million independent tests genomewide in Europeans, and twice that number in Africans.

Across 19 traits, our improved model leads to estimates of common SNP heritability on average 43\% (s.d. 3\%) higher than those obtained from the widely used software GCTA and 25\% (s.d. 2\%) higher than those from the recently proposed extension GCTA-LDMS.

	abstract = {The genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach has discovered hundreds of genetic variants associated with diseases and quantitative traits. However, despite clinical overlap and statistical correlation between many phenotypes, GWAS are generally performed one-phenotype-at-a-time. Here we compare the performance of modelling multiple phenotypes jointly with that of the standard univariate approach. We introduce a new method and software, MultiPhen, that models multiple phenotypes simultaneously in a fast and interpretable way. By performing ordinal regression, MultiPhen tests the linear combination of phenotypes most associated with the genotypes at each SNP, and thus potentially captures effects hidden to single phenotype GWAS. We demonstrate via simulation that this approach provides a dramatic increase in power in many scenarios. There is a boost in power for variants that affect multiple phenotypes and for those that affect only one phenotype. While other multivariate methods have similar power gains, we describe several benefits of MultiPhen over these. In particular, we demonstrate that other multivariate methods that assume the genotypes are normally distributed, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and MANOVA, can have highly inflated type-1 error rates when testing case-control or non-normal continuous phenotypes, while MultiPhen produces no such inflation. To test the performance of MultiPhen on real data we applied it to lipid traits in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). In these data MultiPhen discovers 21\% more independent SNPs with known associations than the standard univariate GWAS approach, while applying MultiPhen in addition to the standard approach provides 37\% increased discovery. The most associated linear combinations of the lipids estimated by MultiPhen at the leading SNPs accurately reflect the Friedewald Formula, suggesting that MultiPhen could be used to refine the definition of existing phenotypes or uncover novel heritable phenotypes.},

Numerous multi-trait GWAS methods that exploit either summary statistics or individual-level data have been developed, but their relative performance is unclear. Here we develop a simulation framework to model the complex networks underlying multivariate genetic epidemiology, enabling the vast model space of genetic effects on multiple correlated traits to be explored systematically. We perform a comprehensive comparison of the leading multi-trait GWAS methods, finding: (1) method performance is highly sensitive to the specific combination of genetic effects and phenotypic correlations, (2) most of the current multivariate methods have remarkably similar statistical power, and (3) multivariate methods may offer a substantial increase in the discovery of genetic variants over the standard univariate approach. We believe our findings offer the clearest picture to date of the relative performance of multi-trait GWAS methods and act as a guide for method selection. We provide a web application and open-source software program implementing our simulation framework, for: (i) further benchmarking of multivariate GWAS methods, (ii) power calculations for multivariate genetic studies, and (iii) generating data for testing any multivariate method in genetic epidemiology.},

For 3152 unrelated 16-year-old individuals representative of the United Kingdom, we created 13 GPS from the largest GWAS for psychiatric disorders (for example, schizophrenia, depression and dementia) and cognitive traits (for example, intelligence, educational attainment and intracranial volume). The behavioral phenome included 50 traits from the domains of psychopathology, personality, cognitive abilities and educational achievement. We examined phenome-wide profiles of associations for the entire distribution of each GPS and for the extremes of the GPS distributions. The cognitive GPS yielded stronger predictive power than the psychiatric GPS in our UK-representative sample of adolescents. For example, education GPS explained variation in adolescents’ behavior problems ({\textasciitilde}0.6\%) and in educational achievement ({\textasciitilde}2\%) but psychiatric GPS were associated with neither. Despite the modest effect sizes of current GPS, quantile analyses illustrate the ability to stratify individuals by GPS and opportunities for research. For example, the highest and lowest septiles for the education GPS yielded a 0.5 s.d. difference in mean math grade and a 0.25 s.d. difference in mean behavior problems. We discuss the usefulness and limitations of GPS based on adult GWAS to predict genetic propensities earlier in development.},

	abstract = {Background

Complex psychiatric traits have long been thought to be the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and gene–environment interactions are thought to play a crucial role in behavioral phenotypes and the susceptibility and progression of psychiatric disorders. Candidate gene studies to investigate hypothesized gene–environment interactions are now fairly common in human genetic research, and with the shift toward genome-wide association studies, genome-wide gene–environment interaction studies are beginning to emerge.


Methods

We summarize the basic ideas behind gene–environment interaction, and provide an overview of possible study designs and traditional analysis methods in the context of genome-wide analysis. We then discuss novel approaches beyond the traditional strategy of analyzing the interaction between the environmental factor and each polymorphism individually.


Results

Two-step filtering approaches that reduce the number of polymorphisms tested for interactions can substantially increase the power of genome-wide gene–environment studies. New analytical methods including data-mining approaches, and gene-level and pathway-level analyses, also have the capacity to improve our understanding of how complex genetic and environmental factors interact to influence psychologic and psychiatric traits. Such methods, however, have not yet been utilized much in behavioral and mental health research.


Conclusions

Although methods to investigate gene–environment interactions are available, there is a need for further development and extension of these methods to identify gene–environment interactions in the context of genome-wide association studies. These novel approaches need to be applied in studies of psychology and psychiatry.},

Such inference has been demonstrated for individuals’ country of birth, but here we use data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966) to investigate the characteristics of genetic structure within a population and subsequently develop a method for inferring location to a finer scale. Principal component analysis (PCA) shows that while the first PCs are particularly informative for location, there is also location information in the higher-order PCs, but it cannot be captured by a linear model. We introduce a new method, pcLOCATE, which is able to exploit this information to improve the accuracy of location inference. pcLOCATE uses individuals’ PC values to estimate the probability of birth in each town and then averages over all towns to give an estimated longitude and latitude of birth using a fully Bayesian model. We apply pcLOCATE to the NFBC1966 data to estimate parental birthplace, testing with successively more PCs and finding the model with the top 23 PCs most accurate, with a median distance of 23 km between the estimated and the true location. pcLOCATE predicts the most recent residence of NFBC1966 individuals to a median distance of 47 km. We also apply pcLOCATE to Indian individuals from the London Life Sciences Prospective Population Study (LOLIPOP) data, and find that birthplace is predicated to a median distance of 54 km from the true location. A method with such accuracy is potentially valuable in population genetics and forensics.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there have been major developments of population genetics methods to estimate both rates of recombination and levels of natural selection. However, genomic variants subject to positive selection are likely to have arisen recently and, consequently, had less opportunity to be affected by recombination. Thus, the two processes have an intimately related impact on genetic variation, and inference of either may be vulnerable to confounding by the other. We illustrate here that even modest levels of positive selection can substantially reduce population-based recombination rate estimates. We also show that genome-wide scans to detect loci under recent selection in humans have tended to highlight loci in regions of low recombination, suggesting that confounding by recombination rate may have reduced the power of these studies. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new genome-wide approach for detecting selection, based on the ratio of pedigree-based to population-based estimates of recombination rate. Simulations suggest that our “Ped/Pop” method, which is designed to capture completed sweeps, has good power to discriminate between neutral and adaptive evolution. Unusually for a multimarker method, our approach performs well in regions of high recombination and also has good power for many generations after the fixation of an advantageous variant. We apply the method to human HapMap and Perlegen data sets, finding confirmation of reported candidates as well as identifying new loci that may have undergone recent intense selection.},

Here we analyze the NFBC1966 and ALSPAC birth cohorts to investigate the genetic determinants of a key developmental process: primary tooth development. The prospective nature of our studies allows us to exploit accurate measurements of age at first tooth eruption and number of teeth at one year, and also provides the opportunity to assess whether genetic variants affecting these traits are associated with dental problems later in the life course. Of the genes that we find to be associated with primary tooth development, several have established roles in tooth development and growth, and almost half have proposed links with the development of cancer. We find that one of the variants is also associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment later in life. Our findings should provide a strong foundation for the study of the genetic architecture of tooth development, which as well as its relevance to medicine and dentistry, may have implications in evolutionary biology since teeth represent important markers of evolution.},

	abstract = {Excessive alcohol consumption is a major public health problem worldwide. Although drinking habits are known to be inherited, few genes have been identified that are robustly linked to alcohol drinking. We conducted a genome-wide association metaanalysis and replication study among {\textgreater}105,000 individuals of European ancestry and identified β-Klotho (KLB) as a locus associated with alcohol consumption (rs11940694; P = 9.2 × 10−12). β-Klotho is an obligate coreceptor for the hormone FGF21, which is secreted from the liver and implicated in macronutrient preference in humans. We show that brain-specific β-Klotho KO mice have an increased alcohol preference and that FGF21 inhibits alcohol drinking by acting on the brain. These data suggest that a liver–brain endocrine axis may play an important role in the regulation of alcohol drinking behavior and provide a unique pharmacologic target for reducing alcohol consumption.},

In a clinical sample of first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients, we estimated the ability of PRSs to discriminate case-control status and to predict the development of schizophrenia as opposed to other psychoses. The sample (445 case and 265 control subjects) was genotyped on the Illumina HumanCore Exome BeadChip with an additional 828 control subjects of African ancestry genotyped on the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array. To calculate PRSs, we used the results from the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia meta-analysis. We examined the association of PRSs with case-control status and with schizophrenia versus other psychoses in European and African ancestry FEP patients and in a second sample of 248 case subjects with chronic psychosis. PRS had good discriminative ability of case-control status in FEP European ancestry individuals (9.4\% of the variance explained, p {\textless} 10−6), but lower in individuals of African ancestry (R2 = 1.1\%, p = .004). Furthermore, PRS distinguished European ancestry case subjects who went on to acquire a schizophrenia diagnosis from those who developed other psychotic disorders (R2 = 9.2\%, p = .002). PRS was a powerful predictor of case-control status in a European sample of patients with FEP, even though a large proportion did not have an established diagnosis of schizophrenia at the time of assessment. PRS was significantly different between those case subjects who developed schizophrenia from those who did not, although the discriminative accuracy may not yet be sufficient for clinical utility in FEP.},

However, there is a lack of robust platforms for a comprehensive downstream analysis. In the present study, we first proposed three novel algorithms, sequence gap-filled gene feature annotation, bit-block encoded genotypes and sectional fast access to text lines to address three fundamental problems. The three algorithms then formed the infrastructure of a robust parallel computing framework, KGGSeq, for integrating downstream analysis functions for whole genome sequencing data. KGGSeq has been equipped with a comprehensive set of analysis functions for quality control, filtration, annotation, pathogenic prediction and statistical tests. In the tests with whole genome sequencing data from 1000 Genomes Project, KGGSeq annotated several thousand more reliable non-synonymous variants than other widely used tools (e.g. ANNOVAR and SNPEff). It took only around half an hour on a small server with 10 CPUs to access genotypes of ∼60 million variants of 2504 subjects, while a popular alternative tool required around one day. KGGSeq's bit-block genotype format used 1.5\% or less space to flexibly represent phased or unphased genotypes with multiple alleles and achieved a speed of over 1000 times faster to calculate genotypic correlation.},

They can be used to group participants into different risk categories for diseases, and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A number of possible ways of calculating PGS have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is how we can use LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question, we propose a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we call lassosum. We also propose a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. In our simulations, we showed that pseudovalidation often resulted in prediction accuracy that is comparable to using a dataset with validation phenotype and was clearly superior to the conservative option of setting the tuning parameter of lassosum to its lowest value. We also showed that lassosum achieved better prediction accuracy than simple clumping and P-value thresholding in almost all scenarios. It was also substantially faster and more accurate than the recently proposed LDpred.},

Usually it is constructed as a linear combination of SNP genotype weighted by the SNP-wise regression coefficient of the SNP to the phenotype using SNPs with p values smaller than a particular threshold. Commonly a range of thresholds are used which can pose problems with multiple comparisons as well as over-fitting. Here, an alternative weighting scheme is proposed, making use of the local true discovery rate, estimated from summary statistics. Two methods of estimation are proposed—maximum likelihood and kernel density estimation. Simulation studies using real and artificial data suggest this new weighting scheme is highly comparable with standard polygenic scores using the best possible p value threshold in prediction, even though this threshold is not normally known in practice.},

With the growth of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in the past decade, how far have we reached this goal? In this study we explored the predictive ability of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) derived from GWAS for a range of complex disease and traits.Results: We first proposed a new approach to evaluate predictive performances of PRS at arbitrary P-value thresholds. The method was based on corrected estimates of effect sizes, accounting for possible false positives and selection bias. This approach requires no distributional assumptions and only requires summary statistics as input. The validity of the approach was verified in simulations. We explored the predictive power of PRS for ten complex traits, including type 2 diabetes (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), triglycerides, high- and low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. We found that the predictive ability of PRS for CAD and DM were modest (best AUC = 0.608 and 0.607) while for lipid traits the prediction R-squared ranged from 16.1 to 29.8\%. For psychiatric disorders, the predictive power for SCZ was estimated to be the highest (best AUC 0.820), followed by BD. Predictive performance of other psychiatric disorders ranged from 0.543 to 0.585. Psychiatric traits tend to have more gradual rise in AUC when significance thresholds increase and achieve the best predictive power at higher P-values than cardiometabolic traits.Contact:hcso@cuhk.edu.hk; pcsham@hku.hkSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, most available training data involves European samples, and it is currently unclear how to accurately predict disease risk in other populations. Previous studies have used either training data from European samples in large sample size or training data from the target population in small sample size, but not both. Here, we introduce a multi-ethnic polygenic risk score that combines training data from European samples and training data from the target population. We applied this approach to predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a Latino cohort using both publicly available European summary statistics in large sample size and Latino training data in small sample size. We attained a {\textgreater}70\% relative improvement in prediction accuracy (from R2=0.027 to R2=0.047) compared to methods that use only one source of training data, consistent with large relative improvements in simulations. We observed a systematically lower load of T2D risk alleles in Latino individuals with more European ancestry, which could be explained by polygenic selection in ancestral European and/or Native American populations. Application of our approach to predict T2D in a South Asian UK Biobank cohort attained a {\textgreater}70\% relative improvement in prediction accuracy, and application to predict height in an African UK Biobank cohort attained a 30\% relative improvement. Our work reduces the gap in polygenic risk prediction accuracy between European and non-European target populations.},

These studies have produced extensive repositories of genetic variation and trait measurements across large numbers of individuals, providing tremendous opportunities for further analyses. However, privacy concerns and other logistical considerations often limit access to individual-level genetic data, motivating the development of methods that analyse summary association statistics. Here, we review recent progress on statistical methods that leverage summary association data to gain insights into the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases.},

We modeled the genetic architecture underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for rheumatoid arthritis and developed a new method using polygenic risk-score analyses to infer the total liability-scale variance explained by associated GWAS SNPs. Using this method, we estimated that, together, thousands of SNPs from rheumatoid arthritis GWAS explain an additional 20\% of disease risk (excluding known associated loci). We further tested this method on datasets for three additional diseases and obtained comparable estimates for celiac disease (43\% excluding the major histocompatibility complex), myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease (48\%) and type 2 diabetes (49\%). Our results are consistent with simulated genetic models in which hundreds of associated loci harbor common causal variants and a smaller number of loci harbor multiple rare causal variants. These analyses suggest that GWAS will continue to be highly productive for the discovery of additional susceptibility loci for common diseases.},

	abstract = {We construct genomic predictors for heritable and extremely complex human quantitative traits (height, heel bone density, and educational attainment) using modern methods in high dimensional statistics (i.e., machine learning). Replication tests show that these predictors capture, respectively, {\textasciitilde}40, 20, and 9 percent of total variance for the three traits. For example, predicted heights correlate {\textasciitilde}0.65 with actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation samples are within a few cm of the prediction. The variance captured for height is comparable to the estimated SNP heritability from GCTA (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for the SNPs used. Thus, our results resolve the common SNP portion of the "missing heritability" problem - i.e., the gap between prediction R-squared and SNP heritability. The {\textasciitilde}20k activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture of human height, at least for common SNPs. Our primary dataset is the UK Biobank cohort, comprised of almost 500k individual genotypes with multiple phenotypes. We also use other datasets and SNPs found in earlier GWAS for out-of-sample validation of our results.},

	abstract = {Author summary Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a valuable tool for the discovery of genes that protect or predispose individuals to common complex diseases. It can though be hampered by excessive heterogeneity among its participating studies. To date, the impact of heterogeneity is assessed locally on an individual SNP basis using Q, I2 and τ2 statistics. Here, we present a new heterogeneity statistic, M that assesses genomic (multi-SNP) patterns of heterogeneity in GWAS meta-analysis with enhanced power compared to conventional methods. When applied to a recent GWAS meta-analysis of coronary artery disease, the new statistic revealed substantial patterns of systematic heterogeneity, much of which was attributed to differences in ancestry, age-of—disease onset and family history of disease. The new method can dissect genomic heterogeneity patterns to flag underperforming studies that could comprise the power of the meta-analysis as well as identify influential studies with advantageous design features to inform future meta-analyses of multifactorial disease.},
